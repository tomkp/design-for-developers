Tips on UI work for developers


### Alignment

Try and ensure that items on the page line up. 
Aligning vertically and horizontally is the simplest way to improve a UI.

###  Spacing

Try and use the same spacing throughout.

###  Rhythm


###  Fonts

Use a single font. Choose a profressional font.

###  Colours

Start with black and white. Add colour later - and then only as necessary.

Avoid the default colours and choose a palette
