Tips on UI work for developers


### Alignment

Try and ensure that items on the page line up. 
Aligning vertically and horizontally is the simplest way to improve a UI.

###  Spacing

Try and use the same spacing throughout.

###  Rhythm


###  Fonts

Use a single font. Choose a profressional font.

###  Colours

Start with black and white. Add colour later - and then only as necessary.

Avoid the default colours and choose someone elses  palette:

* [A nicer color palette for the web](http://clrs.cc/)
* [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
* [flat design colors](http://www.flatdesigncolors.com/)
* [flat ui colors](http://flatuicolors.com/)

###  CSS resets

Use [normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to set base styles.
